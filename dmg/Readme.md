To the people that I sent here, you're in the right place. Keep going.. :-).  

This is the DMG I refered to in that Post.. Go man, Go, you're on the right path to success.

To the People Landing here from a Search for iOS binary arm, or otherwise.. you are coming to a Repo in a Blind manner and you really should not be downloading anything from here, it'll probably brick your iphone, or make other changes to boot args. 

So be careful what you download from the Internet, these files are for troubleshooting a specific technical support issue and has a very specific context and target audience.
