There are some files I use for Research Projects..

There may be many files here... 

The file named 'client' is a Binary ARM file for TFTP Command Line on iOS and its signed with my Developer ID.

usage: ./client [-p port] [-h hostname] -f filename


Reminder: Its a TFTP CLI Executable, so you need a TFTP Server and a few other things to make it all work..
