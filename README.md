# ios-arm-research
iOS, ARM, Research

Repo was cleaned January 29, 2021. You're probably looking for the Private Repo, so check the slack channel for updates...

This Repo contains research code, binaries, scripts, snippets, notes, comments etc for my ios arm research

Currently, the Repo hosts a TFTP Server and Client as noted in that Private Post.

usage: client [-p port] [-h hostname] -f filename
client will send filename to any TFTP Server

Note to those coming to this Repo in a Blind manner.. you really don't want to be downloading anything here, it'll probably brick you iphone, on purpose.

To those who land here Blind, be so careful what you download from the Internet.. these files are for troubleshoot technical support issue and have a very specific context.

To the people that I sent here, refer back to Slack and get the updatd link.
